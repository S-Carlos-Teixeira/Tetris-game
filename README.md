## Brief

Tetris is a puzzle game where the player has to fit different shaped blocks (called Tetriminos) together so that they make a complete line across the playing board. Once a line is achieved it is removed from the game board and the player's score is increased.

The player can move the Tetriminos left and right and rotate them clockwise in 90ยบ increments.

The aim of the game is to get as many points as possible before the game board is filled with Tetriminos.

#### Requirements
* The game should stop if a Tetrimino fills the highest row of the game board
* The player should be able to rotate each Tetrimino about its own axis
* If a line is completed it should be removed and the pieces above should take its place

## Planning

A whiteboard was used to sketch and plan the project, it gives a brief idea of the project's challenges and how these can be addressed.
